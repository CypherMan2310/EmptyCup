# EmptyCup
This is the submition of the project that was asked to build by the firm EmptyCup as a way of evaluation for their internship role
This project had 4 stages of building
1) Web Styling
2) Js Functions
3) Backend Integration
4) Deployment
##Web Styling
this was the main part of the webpage where we had to build a webpage for the moobile users to interact with
so this was done

##Js Function
The Shortlist Function present on the web page had to toggle as the users were using it so this was done using js in the sction on click as using if statements to judge if the button was toggled or not
so as written on the code we can see the toogle works both ways using two if statements
it toggels between the images i have uploaded from the canva design
##Backend Integration
I havent used any databases in this projects i have used a static JSON file that can change the static webpage into a dynamic one
the javascript and the flask server are used to complete this task the code for the dynamic page is still under development but it can still be used
##Deployment
I have included a two docker file that are used for the loacl and the cloud  deployment purposes
